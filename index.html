        <p>Tennessee is now my home.<br>
        Its where I live. Its where I met my wife, Laurie.<br>
        Its where I follow the best <i>FOOTBALL</i> (I will never call it soccer) team in the world, Memphis 901!<br>
        I first came here is February 2016 for 2 weeks, and knew I wanted to come back.
        I came here repeadedly for the next 2 years and have now settled here.</p>

        <br><br>
        I have not spent much time in Mississippi, however I have played golf a few times here.
        They have some very good courses.<br>
        I am also a frequent visitor to Sweet Peppers Deli in Olive Branch.<br>
        The best time I've had in MS was a road trip to Oxford to see Ole Miss vs The Tigers!<br>
        What a sight the Grove is! Amazing that a college team can get so many fans at a game!</p>

        <p>Quite possibly my favourite place I've visited!<br>
        Laurie and I went to Chicago for our honeymoon.<br>
        I would highly recommend that you try to take the architecture boat tour here,  
        and also eat at the restaurant "Steak 48"...it was amazing!!!</p>

        <p>I've been here a few times now as it is where I pass through on my way home to Scotland.<br>
        By far though, the best trip was Dec 2018 where I went with Laurie and my parents,
        who were over to visit us for a month.<br>
        We got so much done...Ellis Island, 9/11 museum, various cathedrals...plus we even got
        to see the Rockettes! Fantastic trip!!!</p>

        <p>Laurie is originally from Oregon, so she has lots of family here.<br>
        We went in Aug 2017 for her cousins wedding...my first taste of how the USA do it!<br>
        I had a great time and I still managed to show the youngin's how to party!
        Going back again in Aug 2019 for another cousins wedding. Can't wait!</p>
